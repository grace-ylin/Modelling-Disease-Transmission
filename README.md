# Modelling-Disease-Transmission

## Abstract 
Equitable allocation of resources like vaccines are a central challenge in epidemic response, particularly when disease burden is unequally distributed across population subgroups. Most existing research prioritizes efficiency, by minimizing infections or deaths, while giving less attention to the equity implications of these strategies. Real-world populations exhibit disparities in transmission risk and disease vulnerability, raising questions about how to allocate limited resources fairly. To address this gap, we aim to systematically characterize the equity-efficiency tradeoff and identify disparity contexts where equity goals become more or less costly. We developed a deterministic compartmental epidemic model based on an extended Susceptible-Infected-Recovered framework, with two subgroups having heterogeneous transmission and mortality rates. We evaluated four equity-aware optimization strategies from the literature. For each disparity metric, we fixed one group’s parameter, varying the other’s across four values. We simulated these scenarios, recording the optimal allocation under each strategy and the resulting deaths and infections. Preliminary simulations show that the “cost of fairness”– the efficiency loss when shifting from an efficiency-optimal to a fairness-constrained solution– varies with the type of disparity and optimization strategy, with some approaches consistently yielding fairer but more costly allocations. Our findings contribute to growing research intersecting epidemiology and social equity. This work offers public health policymakers a clearer understanding of when equity goals can be pursued with minimal loss in overall health outcomes. Future work will extend this to stochastic models and real-world data, bridging the gap between theoretical insights and actionable epidemic response strategies.
